# GMT
Repository of 'GMT: Gzip-based Memory-efficient Time-series Classification'

You can simply run the GMT code by running the jupyter-notebook ('demo.ipynb'). Please download required packages/libraries.

We note that due to the large volume of the original PAMAP2 dataset, the dataset included in the repository is subset (1000 samples) of the full PAMAP2 dataset.
